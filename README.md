Welcome to LevBlockchain!  


LevBlockchain is an website built using MERN stack, with the MVC architecture. It was made as part of the course "Software Engineering for Web".  
The website implements a cryptographic coin, called LevCoin. Each transaction using this coin is part of our blockchain, thus providing integrity.  The LevCoin value is dependent on the ammount of coins that are circulating. The only person that can bring more coins to the market is the manager.   
To register to the website, a person shall give his details and wait for the manager's approval.
